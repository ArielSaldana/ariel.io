summary: 'Exploring the journey of self-empowerment and personal fulfillment as I balance the demands of a tech career with my passion for using software to enact positive change.'

I’ve been contemplating reviving my personal blog for some time. One major hurdle has been the confidential nature of my professional engagements—many of which are bound by NDAs or simply not aligned with public discourse. This constraint has limited my ability to share insights from my work. Furthermore, the technical aspects of my projects, though challenging, might not resonate broadly outside of specialized audiences. After all no one really cares about how a "finance bro" is writing software to make more money.

However, as I look to the future, I am reminded that my identity extends beyond my professional affiliations and the roles I undertake. I am not solely defined by the companies I work for or the projects I execute. Beyond my professional life, I am a person with unique thoughts, ideas, and perspectives that I'd like to share. I have ideas I'd like to share with the world.

Regrettably, in my pursuit of career excellence over the past eight years, I’ve sidelined personal projects that ignite my passion and bring me joy. These projects not only reflect my personal interests but are also avenues through which I aim to use technology for social good, aspiring to leave the world better than I found it.

Moving forward, I intend to strike a fair balance between advancing my career and pursuing personal ambitions. By doing so, I hope to not only enhance my own well-being but also inspire and impact others through the innovative use of software.
