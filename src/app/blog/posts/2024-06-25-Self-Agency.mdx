I've been meaning to get back into writing blog posts for a long time now. It seems that every time I was ready to dive in, something held me back. Be it a corporate job taking most of my time, or the confidential nature of my professional work, much of which is bound by NDAs or otherwise not suitable for public discourse. Ultimately, it might just been my personal belief that no one really cared to read about how a "finance bro" is writing software to make a massive firm more money, except maybe those wishing to do the same thing over at their outfit. I miss the days when I could openly write not just blogs about the exciting things I was working on, but also about open-source initiatives.

Regrettably, in my pursuit of career excellence over the past eight years, Iâ€™ve sidelined personal projects that ignite my passion and bring me joy. These projects not only reflect my personal interests but are also avenues through which I aim to use technology for social good, aspiring to leave the world better than I found it.

However, as I look to the future, I am reminded that my identity extends beyond my professional affiliations and the roles I undertake. I am not solely defined by the companies I work for or the projects I execute. Beyond my professional life, I am a person with actual thoughts, ideas, and perspectives that I'd like to share.

As I look to the future, I intend to strike a fair balance between advancing my career and pursuing personal ambitions. By doing so, I hope to not only enhance my own wellbeing but also inspire and impact others through the innovative use of software.

With all that said, there have been some projects that I've been working on for some time that are not quite ready for the world, but which I am excited to share. I hope you find them as interesting as I do. Stay tuned for more updates!
